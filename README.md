# Divine Court WASP Defense System

This repository contains Cloudflare Workers and resources that implement a two‑part DDoS defence system. It includes a WASP Edge worker to shield your zones from attacks, a case‑ingestor queue consumer to record events and compute metrics, a D1 schema, and a minimal transparency page.

The system automatically records attack events, computes defensive metrics, and generates draft abuse reports and Section 504 informations within Canadian law.
